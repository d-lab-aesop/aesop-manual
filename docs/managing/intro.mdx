# Introduction to Airtable

:::tip TL;DR

## What is Airtable?

Airtable is a __spreadsheet-like,__ cloud-based service designed to make it easy for individuals and small organizations with simpler requirements and limited tech resources to set up and administer their own collaborative __databases.__ Airtable is a commercial service, but the company offers a [free tier](https://airtable.com/pricing) to get started, as well as [discounted plans](https://support.airtable.com/docs/nonprofit-and-educational-plans-faqs) for educational and non-profit users. 

While we are actively exploring open-source alternatives, Airtable is currently the best option for supporting AESOP analysis. It has the advantages of being widely adopted, extensively documented, and relatively easy to use. Because AESOP is still early in its evolution, we're taking advantage of Airtable's ability to set up simple interfaces and automations that run directly on its servers to prototype out the core workflow.

## Relational database 101
Airtable stores data in a __relational database.__ A relational database stores data in tables (as columns and rows):
- Each **row** represents a unique data object called a **"record."** 
- Each **column** is a **field** containing a specific data property, called an **attribute.** 

Each piece of data in the database is thus stored _in relation_ to something else. 
:::note Example of a data record
|Record|Attribute:<br />Color|Attribute:<br />Taste|Attribute:<br />Texture|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Apple**|Red|Sweet|Hard|
|**Lemon**|Yellow|Sour|Firm|
|**Banana**|Yellow|Sweet|Soft|

## Getting started with Airtable

Airtable offers a 12-minute video tutorial to orient new users to its core functionality:

We think the best way to get started is to import an existing spreadsheet into Airtable and play around with the interface. Keep the following tips in mind, and you'll be up and running in no time.

:::info TIP
1. A well-structured database **avoids data duplication.** Information exists in a single location, and is referenced in other places where necessary. This helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that any changes to information are automatically propagated throughout the database. 
2. Airtable's default spreadsheet-like "grid" interface is only one of several data **views.** Pressing `spacebar` with a row highlighted expands the record into a form-like view, and shows its data attributes as **fields** rather than columns. Clicking on the "views" button in the top left corner brings up a menu where you can create additional views of the same data, calendars, cards, and nested lists.  
3. Create a **filter** to tell Airtable to show only the records whose attributes meet specific criteria. Filters are specific to the view they are created in. Create multiple views to quickly toggle between different subsets of data.

:::info Why not just use a spreadsheet?
<details>
Originally developed for quantitative applications like accounting, spreadsheets have come into widespread use for holding, organizing and sharing many different kinds of data. Their popularity stems in large part from their flexibility and simplicity: spreadsheets present data in a table-like row-column format that many people find intuitive. However, that same simplicity also brings significant drawbacks when working with qualitative data:

- Spreadsheets resemble tables (where columns and rows represent meaningful dimensions of data), but are fundamentally just coordinate grids. Data values are indexed positionally (i.e. a "cell" is identified by finding the intersection between its row number and column number), and are not inherently linked to their neighbors. In practice, many users treat spreadsheet as equivalent to tables, using rows of horizontally-adjacent cells to represent individual observations, and using columns to represent different dimensions or aspects of an observation. However, since adjacent cells are not linked on a software level, users risk disrupting the structure of the data every time they insert, duplicate, or delete a cell, row, or column. This presents a challenge when rapidly iterating during early analysis, as well as when collaborating on shared documents. 
- Although datasets that fit on a single page are easily readable at a glance, a spreadsheet interface becomes unwieldy with larger datasets: scrolling becomes laborious and searching gets progressively slower. Finding specific observations becomes harder and harder, since the most popular spreadsheet applications have only limited filtering functionality.
- Spreadsheets lack built-in protection against data duplication. It falls to the user to update a piece of data everywhere it appears whenever they make a change. While it is possible to recreate database-like behavior by referencing cells across separate sheets, this increases the complexity of the spreadsheet and the chance of mistakes when working collaboratively.
