# Welcome to AESOP: Systems from Stories

## What is AESOP?
<ReactPlayer controls playing loop url='img/aesoplong.mp4' />

## Getting Started
:::note
This guide assumes no prior experience with AESOP or qualitative research.
:::

If you're ready to jump right in, you can use the __navigation menu__ to the left of the screen to pull up a topic, or look up specific words or phrases using the __search bar__ in the top right corner. The __outline__ below the search bar lets you jump quickly between different sections of a page.

Alternatively, you can treat this as a step by step tutorial. By the time you reach the end, you should be able to:
- [Edit interview transcripts or other text data into stories](/stories/whystories)
- [Manage story data and metadata](/managing/intro)
- [Extract system dynamics from stories as variables and links](/extracting/intro)
- [Visualize interconnected variables as maps](/mapping/intro)
- [Explore maps to discover patterns and insights](/exploring/intro)

## Requirements
We use [Airtable](https://airtable.com) as a database, and [Kumu](https://kumu.io) as a mapping/visualization tool. Please go ahead and create a free account with each of them if you don't already have one.
