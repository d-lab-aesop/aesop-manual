# Why stories?
For as long as humans have had language, we have relied on stories to make sense of the world.

We tell ourselves stories in order to understand how the world around us works. One way we process our day to day experiences is through constructing narratives of cause and effect. By deciphering why things happened a certain way, and incorporating this new knowledge into our mental models of the universe, we teach ourselves how to act in similar situations in the future.

We tell each other stories for all kinds of reasons: to share, to teach, to entertain, to deceive, to bond. These stories are a portal into our inner lives. They contain not only an account of our experiences, but also hints about our dreams, values, beliefs, and motivations.

At the D-Lab, we believe that by drawing threads from individual stories and weaving them into a map of tangible and intangible motivations, we might begin to grasp the basis of unexpected collective behaviors.
